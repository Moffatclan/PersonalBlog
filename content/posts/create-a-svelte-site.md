I recently used SvelteJS to create [a portfolio of websites I've built](https://danielchapman.dev). <Marginnote count={1}>Right now there's only two websites listed, but I'm sure it will expand over time.</Marginnote> The process of writing the website was fun -- figuring out the syntax of Svelte, using the lovely transition and animation libraries, and playing with event handlers. Here's a quick guide for how you can get started with Svelte.

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a tool for building fast web applications. It's a bit similar to other frontend frameworks like React and Vue. Like React, Svelte constructs components, but unlike React which does its work in the browser at run time, Svelte compiles your app into optimized Javascript code.

I found that writing Svelte code is fun -- it's more like writing vanilla HTML or CSS than writing React -- but the syntax feels different, logic syntax in line, and it has really easy support for animations.

## Creating a Project with Svelte 3

There is a template that you can use as a starting point to create your Svelte project. In your terminal run:

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project
```

This will use npx to run <Tooltip tiptext="Degit is a tool that makes copies of git repositories. If you run `degit some-user/some-repo` it will find the latest commit on https://github.com/some-user/some-repo and download the associated tar file. This is faster than git clone because you're not downloading the entire git history">degit</Tooltip> to create your svelte project.

Next go into the directory and run npm install.

```bash
cd my-svelte-project && npm install
```

Now that all the packages are installed you can start up the development server using `npm run dev` and see your website at <http://localhost:5000>. The information for your file is stored in the file `src/App.svelte`.

## Basic Svelte Structure

The basic structure of a svelte file has a `script` tag, a `style` tag, and the svelte component. The `script` tags are where the brains of your Svelte component go -- variable and function declarations. The `style` tag is where you can write the CSS to style your component and the syntax is vanilla CSS. And finally the svelte component -- for the most part you compose this like you would with HTML or JSX, but there are some exceptions.

The most obvious exception are the if block, each block, and await block which appear in the svelte component.

### If block

The if block displays certain components conditionally.

```html
{#if expression}
<div>
  This div is displayed conditionally.
</div>
{:else}
<div>
  Or this will be displayed
</div>
{/if}
```

### Each block

The each block cycles through an array and displays code a certain way.

```html
<ul>
  {#each items as item}
  <li>{item.name}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

### Await block

The await block waits for asynchronous code to return and then displays content.

```html
{#await promise}
<p>Waiting for the promise</p>
{:then value}
<p>The value is {value}</p>
{/await}
```

## Svelte Transitions & Animations

The real star of my experience with Svelte has been the transitions and animations.

<img src="../assets/svelte-animations.gif" alt="Svelte Animations from danielchapman.dev" style="width:100%;"/>

Transitions are super easy, you just import the transition from svelte and attach it to the element you want to transition. For my website I created a `Bio` component so that if my name is clicked a short introduction will drop down. Implementing this in Svelte was simple. Here's my component with the styles removed:

```jsx
<script>
  import { slide } from "svelte/transition";
  let visible = false;
  let symbol = "▽";
  export let intro;
</script>

<style>
  ...
</style>

<div class="bio">
  <span class="name" on:click={() => (visible = !visible)}>
    <h1>Daniel Chapman</h1>

    <span class="symbol">{visible ? 'x' : '▽'}</span>
  </span>
  {#if visible}
    <div class="about" transition:slide>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="intro">{intro}</div>
    </div>
  {/if}

</div>
```

You'll see a couple things here. First the `on:click` handler which just toggles the `visible` variable. You'll also see that there's an if block that will only display if `visible` is true. Finally in the `div` with the "about" class you'll see the `transition:slide` attribute this tells Svelte how to transition the element when it gets attached to or removed from the DOM.

This is where the magic of Svelte started shining through for me. Svelte has 7 built in transitions to choose from and all you have to do to implement them is import them and add the `transition:transition-name` attribute to the component.

Animations are a little bit more tricky but still intuitive when you get the hang of it. I wanted a hover effect on the website cards I created so I created `on:mouseenter` and `on:mouseleave` handlers that use Svelte's [`tweened`](https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_motion) function from `svelte/motion`. `tweened` is a function that starts at an initial value, then when you call `set(newvalue)`, it gradually moves from that value to the new value taking into consideration a `duration` in milliseconds and an `easing` function that effects how the value is incremented. I used this in combination with a style attribute to gradually animate CSS `box-shadow` when the mouse hovers over a website card.

The relevant code for the animation is below.

```js
<script>
  export let technologies = [];
  export let code = "";
  export let title = "There was no Title";
  export let description = "There was no Description";
  export let link;
  export let image = "";
  let hovered = false;
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  import { fade, slide } from "svelte/transition";
  import { tweened } from "svelte/motion";
  import { cubicOut } from "svelte/easing";

  const shadow = tweened(0, { duration: 500, easing: cubicOut });

  function handleClick() {
    window.location = link;
  }

  function handleMouseEnter() {
    shadow.set(1);
    hovered = true;
  }

  function handleMouseLeave() {
    shadow.set(0);
    hovered = false;
  }

  let mounted = false;
  onMount(() => (mounted = true));
</script>
```

At the top of the code block I define a tweened function called `shadow` which will gets set to 1 in `handleMouseEnter()` and 0 in `handleMouseLeave()`<Marginnote>You'll also see the values `on:touchstart` and `on:touchend`, I discovered that these handle finger presses, so I set them to the equivalent mouse handler.</Marginnote>. It does this over the period of 1/2 a second and uses a cubic easing function (`cubicOut`) Now let's continue to look at the Svelte component below:

```jsx
{#if mounted}
  <div
    on:click={handleClick}
    on:mouseenter={handleMouseEnter}
    on:touchstart={handleMouseEnter}
    on:mouseleave={handleMouseLeave}
    on:touchend={handleMouseLeave}
    transition:slide={{ delay: 200 }}
    style="box-shadow: {$shadow * 30}px {$shadow * 15}px #925c77, {$shadow * 45}px
    {$shadow * 21}px #75B9BE, {$shadow * 60}px {$shadow * 30}px #7297A6;"
    class="site">
    <h2
      class="title"
      transition:fade={{ delay: 250 }}
      style="text-decoration: {hovered ? 'underline' : 'none'};">
      <a href={link}>{title}</a>
    </h2>
    <img src={image} alt="A screenshot of {title}" />
    <div class="description" transition:fade={{ delay: 500 }}>
      {description}
    </div>
    <div class="code">
      <ul>
        {#each technologies as technology}
          <li>{technology}</li>
        {/each}
      </ul>
      <a href={code}>Source Code</a>
    </div>
  </div>
{/if}

```

In the top-level div you'll see there is a style tag. Animating the CSS in Svelte was a simple matter of using the style tag, and because Svelte allows JS within the curly brackets multiplying the `shadow` variable (which moves from 0 to 1 when the mouse is hovered, and from 1 to 0 when the mouse is removed.) by different values to create the triple-layered shadow effect that you can see on the site.

## Conclusion

All in all it took less than a weekend from the moment I started learning Svelte watching [this 19 minute Egghead collection](https://egghead.io/playlists/getting-started-with-svelte-3-05a8541a) to when I finished the rough draft of my website. It might not have taken long, but it was long enough to show me that Svelte is a unique, fun language with powerful functionality.
