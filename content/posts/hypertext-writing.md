Every medium has its strengths. There are considerable strengths inherent to a digital, web-based, way of thinking -- first and foremost is the sheer amount of interactivity and connections you can make.

Now some of these strengths are not inherent to the web. As <Tooltip tiptext="An early pioneer of the internet and the inventor of the term 'hyperlink'">Ted Nelson</Tooltip> points out in his video [Visible Connection](/notes/visible-connection) the written word has used its ability to provide context visually through side by side content, marginalia, paragraph summaries and more ever since the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone).<Footnote count={1}>Don't forget about the footnote/endnote.</Footnote>

But the web allows writers to do crazy things like use [bidirectional links](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) or have additional content appear when <Tooltip tiptext={<span>On my website these tooltips are powered by <a href="/notes/tippy">Tippy JS</a></span>}>hovering over text</Tooltip>, or reference the text of entire books like [The King James Bible](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10/pg10.txt) or [The Complete Works of William Shakespeare](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt). 

The key with any medium is knowing what its strengths are and knowing when you are trying to do something that might be cool, but is not particularly useful. The law of unintended consequences still applies to the web.

## Links distract your reader

What are the side effects of links? One could be that you provide so much information that you end up distracting your reader. [Dense links are helpful for your notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC), but are they helpful to your reader?

Links interrupt the flow of your reader's thought -- that is their inherent strength and weakness. In all writing it's important to know when you introduce a new concept,<Footnote count={2}>Every new concept threatens to lose a reader who doesn't understand or offers them an opportunity to learn. Good writing weaves around potentially new concepts, but it also knows its audience and doesn't explain every little thing - otherwise you lose even more readers.</Footnote> but if you offer a link you are offering your reader a door to disappear down a rabbit hole from which they might never emerge. 

This is an extreme example, but <Tooltip tiptext="Project Xanadu: The culmination of Ted Nelson's vision for what the World Wide Web should have been - featuring bidirectional links, transclusion, and more.">Project Xanadu</Tooltip>'s promise of visual connection to every source referenced in a text sounds great in theory, but the reality is an interconnected web of colored lines that is difficult to interpret. It is cool technology, but does it <Tooltip tiptext={<span>Of course this will vary from reader to reader. Project Xanadu, indeed the very concept of hypertext was created by Ted Nelson to help channel his Attention Deficit Disorder.<Footnote count={3}>See <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">"The Curse of Xanadu"</a>, Wired</Footnote></span>}>help you become a better reader?</Tooltip>

## Links dilute meaning

The other danger is that the sheer amount of links will dilute what you're saying. Sometimes it is easier to pay attention to the meaning of a text if it is all one color. Furthermore, one of the most valuable things I learned from my English degree was that it is sometimes better to assert your opinion without without any hedging or hiding what you, the author, actually think -- and references or links are a way of hiding behind someone else's thoughts.

<Callout>If you don't state your opinion, what sets apart your writing?</Callout>

Of course there has to be a balance -- and in an age where anyone can have a platform to say anything, it is important to know what you know, but also what other people might know better. 

## Writing in hypertext is valuable

Of course throughout this essay I've been using links as I write, because while I do believe that links could be a distraction and that they can dilute meaning, I also firmly believe that it is not my job to decide what you the reader can handle or to somehow trick you into reading every word I've written. I write knowing that you might have followed my link to the 1995 Wired Article on Ted Nelson that was buried in a footnote up above, and you might not come back after opening that link...that's <Tooltip tiptext={<span>I lost an hour when I first discovered that article, and I still want to go back and <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">finish reading it</a>.</span>}>just fine.</Tooltip>

As a writer the internet medium has strengths that I haven't fully utilized before. I believe this digital format allows all of us -- writers and readers -- to make connections in new ways and explore ideas robustly. Certainly I it is important to know the power of putting a link in place and to <Tooltip tiptext={<span>For an example of an essay that does this well, checkout <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/">Hypertext Gardens: Delightful Vistas</a></span>}>limit the number of links</Tooltip> to what could be reasonably explored -- but if each link represents an idea worth exploring, then <Tooltip tiptext="If I believe that truth exists, which I do, than exploration is not something to be scared of, it's something to encourage. The truth can always bear exploration.">who am I to prevent exploration</Tooltip>.

As I write I can explore [different notes](/notes/xanadu) I've written about a subject as well as other resources and I can make new connections that improve my writing. It comes at the cost of distraction, but that cost was there in the old medium too -- anyone who has lost hours in a library as a child knows that it has always been possible to fall down a rabbit hole and discover the worlds that are buried underneath.
