<p class="verse">
At the top of the world there are only trees -<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the only sounds a beating heart,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the traffic of starlings,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the steady hum of silence -<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a wild silence.<br />
<br />
Here the forests stretch -<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;combed, brushed, alert,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the skies painted with snow,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the ground dipped in wildflowers.<br />
<br />
This is no garden laid in perfect rows,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;no vineyards chain the rolling hills,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;no planted fields interrupt the trees,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and my heart says - this is home.<br />
<br />
I have never slept here,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;not once beneath the stars.<br />
The only house for miles<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;lies just beneath my skin.<br />
<br />
But as my lungs expand to fill the sky<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a furrough is ploughed with every breath.<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;There is a planting.<br />
