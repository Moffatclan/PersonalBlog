The cold marble curtain cuts cross her face.  
She looks away, wrapped in stone, no embrace  
in her eyes, which avert their gaze elsewhere,  
past me, though I shift to catch her stare.  
I think some harm or loss troubles her mind,  
but as I move with eyes prepped to be kind,  
the windows to her soul shutter out mine.  
She still looks out, but I can find no line  
in, to see the person hiding inside.  
“Why should two, such as we, try and hide?  
True, we just met, but we share so much.  
We have loved. We have lost. We both long to touch  
our lives to another so that we know  
their heart, and they know the shape of our nose.  
But you hide, and soon I will walk away  
from an immortal face designed to play  
shamelessly reflecting a unique gaze  
through unique eyes. But this world is a maze  
and though we should walk together in pairs,  
we meet lost souls and make our face a wall.”

_Author's note: This poem was the first poem I wrote in [my year of writing one poem every day](/articles/on-writing-poems-daily)_
