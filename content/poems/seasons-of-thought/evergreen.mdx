<p class="verse">
The heart of a tree creaks when the breeze comes in too fast.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it cries as the breeze reminds it that it will die<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;long, tall, and proud as its life might be.<br />
Perhaps it is a battle cry that resounds through sap and wood<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the rage of stability confronted with wild wind.<br />
<br />
Maybe, but when I hear the evergreens sigh<br />
as the wind pulls their branches back and forth,<br />
I hear a giant remembering the first time<br />
the wind pulled at his roots.<br />
I hear his heart break and fill<br />
as mine does,<br />
for I, like him,<br />
remember home.<br />
