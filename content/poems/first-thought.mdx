Time hangs veil-like before my face.  
I remember, through lace, the years  
that spin threads from raw time. Fine threads  
woven, as seconds loom to hours,  
into the sibylline pattern  
that obscures vision of my past.

With veiled face I seek the first thought,  
prying from the pattern a glimpse  
through its first stitch. My fingers trace  
the unraveled spaces searching  
for the foundation of myself,  
the first flash of self-cognition.

My fingers catch. I remember  
through the veil with an infantâ€™s eyes  
a picture unimbued with words.  
I remember the kitchen door,  
no longer home, but always home,  
the moment that defines all homes.

I remember unfamiliar  
walls, made familial by two faces  
anchoring me in this new world.  
They smile, and the moment pauses  
in a long second of warmth.  
The lace hides the rest in darkness.
