War whispers and shouts until fear creeps in.  
Disease festers, rages, grows like cancer  
till all attention strays, drums beat faster,  
thoughts cloud, the earth burns, and still we all sin.  
God stands above the riots and the din.  
He sits and writes; we shout about the news.  
His city floats aloof; he enters in  
the fray unarmed and breaks our guns in two.  
Come, Behold the works of the God made man,  
come with your rage and all your restless fear  
and in his stillness learn to shed a tear  
from him who wept and weeps but took a stand.  
Be still and know that he is God alone.  
His work is done; he sits upon his throne.
