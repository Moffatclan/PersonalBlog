Lifeblood from the writer’s vein bleeds black.  
Black ichor splays out on pages white  
with irregular constancy.  
Sometimes midst the harshest battles  
a single drop is spilled, but empty  
fields cut the poet, bleed him dry.  
Tools vary in this trade. Soldiers  
sally forth armed with only taps,  
draining dark syrup – sweet and sour.  
Taps ancient or automated  
all channel the flows phlebotomal.  
No sign of wounds save stained fingers,  
strained eyes; other wounds stay hidden  
till other eyes read blackened scars.  
Dark work indeed, but from ghastly  
gouges in poetic flesh spring  
stories rich in life and light.
