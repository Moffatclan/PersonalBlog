Lantern lights dance starlike on their cords,  
fishing line strung out with little pearls -  
this evening is a morning fresh and clear  
when every truth rebounds to every ear.  
Resounds with joy, takes up the sound, completes  
the bounds that broke those years ago;  
the bramble grows into a ring of gold.  
Here, two echoes are restored to one  
as He who made the song intended it to be -  
a Lord and Lady - regents of the King.  
And so we dance to bless this feast,  
Lord bless them for that feast, bless us.  
Help us to dance upon this string like dew,  
catch light and make new chords for you.

_Author's Note: This poem was written and performed at the wedding of two friends, and then performed again for two other friends._
