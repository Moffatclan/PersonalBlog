Welcome to my notes. This is an experiment in [[learning in public]]. My goal is that my website be something that I use and that I can look things up when I'm working on writing. I also think there might be value in [[networked thinking]]. That thoughts are powerful when shared, even if they aren't complete when they are shared.

That being said my thoughts are often incomplete and should be viewed and used as such. If you want more polished thoughts, check out my [Articles](/articles) or my [book](/poetry/seasons-of-thought)

I also think that this is an experiment so if this system doesn't work it can be refined or discarded.
