## The Power of Talk in a Digital Age

Author: [[Sherry Turkle]]

“The very sight of a phone on the landscape leaves us feeling less connected to each other, less invested in each other.” (4)

kids are not emotionally developed - “They make acquaintances, but their connections seem superficial” (5)

“computers offer the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship…the illusion of friendship without the demands of intimacy.” (7)
