title: How I write these notes
---

I used to write almost all of my notes using [[bear]]. The great thing about this is was its ability to easily export to markdown and its gorgeous ui design. However [[Ian Jones]] and [[Zac Jones]] recently introduced me to [[Org-Roam]] and [[Doom Emacs]]. This allows me all the power and flexibility of Emacs and [[Org-Mode]] and some of the best features of [[Roam Research]]. This does come at the cost of a beautiful mobile app, but I can still capture my notes on mobile using Bear and export them to my Org-Roam folder.

I also recently discovered [[md-roam]] an extension of org-roam that allows you to have a markdown folder of roam notes. I have successfully synced this with the content/notes folder of my [[gatsby-theme-brain]] on this website to allow my public notes to be easily accessed and updated live in Emacs.

My private brain is fully featured Org-Mode at the moment, but this public brain can be easily browsed and edited on my local machine in markdown.
