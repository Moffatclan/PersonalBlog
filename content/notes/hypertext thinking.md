Part of [[Digital Literacy]] is knowing the strengths of the medium youâ€™re working in. There are considerable strengths inherent to a digital, web-based, way of thinking - first and foremost is the sheer amount of interactivity and connections you can make.

Now some of these strengths are not inherent to the web. As Ted Nelson points out in his video [[Visible Connection]] the written word has used its ability to provide context visually through side by side content, marginalia, paragraph summaries and more starting with the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)

But the web allows us to do crazy things like use [bidirectional notes](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) or have content appear when hovering, or just link to the text of entire books like [The King James Bible](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10/pg10.txt) or [The Complete Works of William Shakespeare](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt).
