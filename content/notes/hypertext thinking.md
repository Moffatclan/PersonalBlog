title: Hypertext Thinking
---

Every medium has its strengths. There are considerable strengths inherent to a digital, web-based, way of thinking -- first and foremost is the sheer amount of interactivity and connections you can make.

Now some of these strengths are not inherent to the web. As <Tooltip tiptext="The inventor of the term 'hyperlink'">Ted Nelson</Tooltip> points out in his video [[Visible Connection]] the written word has used its ability to provide context visually through side by side content, marginalia, paragraph summaries and more ever since the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone).<Footnote count={1}>Don't forget about the footnote/endnote.</Footnote>

But the web allows us to do crazy things like use [bidirectional links](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) or have content appear when <Tooltip tiptext={<span>On my website these tooltips are powered by <a href="/notes/tippy">Tippy JS</a></span>}>hovering over text</Tooltip>, or just link to the text of entire books like [The King James Bible](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10/pg10.txt) or [The Complete Works of William Shakespeare](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt). The key with any technology is knowing what its strengths are and knowing when you are trying to do something that might be cool, but is not particularly useful. 

The law of unintended consequences still applies to the web.

## Links distract your reader

What are the side effects of links? One could be that you provide so much information that you end up distracting your reader. [Dense links are helpful for your notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC), but are they helpful to your reader?

Links interrupt the flow of your reader's thought -- that is their inherent strength and weakness. In all writing it's important to know when you introduce a new concept,<Footnote count={2}>Every new concept threatens to lose a reader who doesn't understand or offers them an opportunity to learn. Good writing weaves around potentially new concepts, but it also knows its audience and doesn't explain every little thing - otherwise you lose even more readers.</Footnote> but if you offer a link you are offering your reader a door to disappear down a rabbit hole from which they might never emerge. 

This is an extreme example, but <Tooltip tiptext="Project Xanadu: The culmination of Ted Nelson's vision for what the World Wide Web should have been - featuring bidirectional links, transclusion, and more.">Project Xanadu</Tooltip>'s promise of visual connection to every source referenced in a text sounds great in theory, but the reality is an interconnected web of colored lines that is difficult to interpret. It is cool technology, but does it <Tooltip tiptext={<span>Of course this will vary from reader to reader. Project Xanadu, indeed the very concept of hypertext was created by Ted Nelson to help channel his Attention Deficit Disorder.<Footnote count={3}>See <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">"The Curse of Xanadu", Wired</a></Footnote></span>}>help you become a better reader?</Tooltip>

## Links dilute meaning

The other danger is that the sheer amount of links will dilute what you're saying. Sometimes it is easier to pay attention to the meaning of a text if it is all one color. Furthermore, one of the most valuable things I learned from my English degree was that it is sometimes better to assert your opinion without without any hedging or hiding what you, the author, actually think -- and references or links are a way of hiding behind someone else's thoughts.

<Callout>If you don't state your opinion, what sets apart your writing?</Callout>

Of course there has to be a balance -- and in an age where anyone can have a platform to say anything, it is important to know what you know, but also what other people might know better.
