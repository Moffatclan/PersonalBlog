title: difference between em and rem
---

In [[CSS]] units of measurement are used to define styles. Two of those units are `em` and `rem`. They are similar `em` is a unit of size relative to the font-size of a parent element, while `rem` is a unit of size relative to the root element. This means that `em`'s will change based on the relative size of their parent element's font - they are relative - whereas `rem`'s should be the same throughout.
