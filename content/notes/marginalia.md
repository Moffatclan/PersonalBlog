title: Marginalia
---

Marginalia are marks made at the edges of the page (whether digital or physical). They can be printed by the author/publisher or written by the end user. 

In my website I use a specialize `Marginnote` [[React]] component that is adapted from [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).<Marginnote count={1}>This is what a margin note looks like.</Marginnote> This allows me to put marginalia content on the side (or in-line on mobile). This is also how I choose to handle footnotes, although in a book footnotes would of course go in the footer of the document.<Footnote count={1}>And this is a footnote.</Footnote>

## Credit
I got the idea from [[Maggie Appleton]]'s website.
