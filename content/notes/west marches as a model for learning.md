title: West Marches as a Model for Learning
---

I first heard about West Marches 2 years ago when I was researching Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) to run a short-lived campaign for some friends. I started watching content on youtube and came across this video from Matt Colville

In the video he summarizes [this write up](http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/) from Ben Robbins summarizing a game he ran for 2 years.

These are my notes summarizing that video and article.

## What is a West March Campaign

Ben Robbins ran a D&D game set in &ldquo;The West Marches&rdquo; that had the following characteristics:

-   No regular time: scheduled by players on the fly
-   No regular party: each game had different players drawn from a pool of around 10-14 people
-   No regular plot: the players decided where to go and what to do. (Essentially a sandbox game)

Joel Hooks tweeted about how learning (especially in a tech/development context) could be similar to D&D and how he&rsquo;s looked at book clubs as analagous to running a D&D campaign.

Continuing in that vein what would it look like to organize learning in that way?

-   A pool of learners who are all different and would be interested in learning different things at different times.
-   No regular group - some people want to learn this topic and so gather for a lecture or discussion, others want to learn something else.
-   A map of possible subjects that learners can tackle. Some of these classes or discussion group haven&rsquo;t been thought about yet, but can be prepared when learners express interest. This is especially easy if the discussion group is around a book because the leader of the discussion group only has to read and prepare the chapter that is discussed.
-   &ldquo;Campaign&rdquo; reports - summarize what happened and what was learned at a lecture or discussion group. This helps learners internalize what they learned but also gives others some insight and might lead another &ldquo;party&rdquo; of learners to decide to tackle the book (which will be easier to do now that the leader has already led one discussion)
