---

The concept of networked thinking -- especially linked/graphable connections like those in [[Obsidian]], [[Roam Research]], and [[org-roam]] -- assume that there's some value in networked thinking. That there's something true or valuable in the connection itself.

Related to [[hypertext thinking]].
