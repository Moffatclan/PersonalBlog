Redesigning my [[website]]. Goal is to make it easier to create content, and to make content a) rich and b) discoverable.

- [ ] Implement [[Blogchains]]
- [ ] Implement [gatsby-redirect-from | GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-redirect-from/) so that when a note gets turned into an article you can still redirect
- [x] Add notes section - maybe in the form of a writing desk
- [x] Implement [[OpenGraph]] images
- [ ] Implement Link previews with Tippy.js
- [x] Have tags from poems and other places get referenced in the brain
