title: Ephemeral Scratchings
aliases: ['ephemeral scratching']

These are the notes that I take in passing, the "pad of paper" I keep near my desk at all times. If the idea is worth building out it can be extracted into its own note to be completed later, or passed to my todos to be completed later.

Ephemeral scratchings are also an opportunity to [[playfully learn]] -- the stakes are low so its easy to explore, and have fun with an idea.

For me these notes live in my [[Org Journal]] files, which means I don&rsquo;t go back and update them later. But it is still useful because of [[Org-Roam]] backlinks.
