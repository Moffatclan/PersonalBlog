## Introduction Notes

To wield [[Clojure]] to its fullest, you’ll need to find your way through the four labyrinths that face every programmer learning a new language:

-   **The Forest of Tooling:** A friendly and efficient programming environment makes it easy to try your ideas. You’ll learn how to set up your environment.
-   **The Mountain of Language:** As you ascend, you’ll gain knowledge of Clojure’s syntax, semantics, and data structures. You’ll learn how to use one of the mightiest programming tools, the macro, and learn how to simplify your life with Clojure’s concurrency constructs.
-   **The Cave of Artifacts:** In its depths you’ll learn to build, run, and distribute your own programs, and how to use code libraries. You’ll also learn Clojure’s relationship to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
-   **The Cloud Castle of Mindset:** In its rarefied air, you’ll come to know the why and how of Lisp and functional programming. You’ll learn about the philosophy of simplicity that permeates Clojure, and how to solve problems like a Clojurist.
-   This book assumes zero experience with the JVM, [[functional programming]], or [[Lisp]]. It covers these topics in detail so you’ll feel confident about what you’re doing when you build and run Clojure programs.
-   It eschews real-world examples in favor of more interesting exercises, like assaulting hobbits and tracking glittery vampires.
