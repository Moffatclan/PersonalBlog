          Seasons of Thought is a collection of poetry that traces its themes
          across the changing seasons. The poems in the collection use the
          passage of time as a canvas to explore nature, family, childhood,
          faith, and other aspects of the human condition. Seasons of Thought is
          my first collection of poetry which came out of a year-long project{' '}
