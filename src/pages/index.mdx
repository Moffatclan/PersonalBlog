# I'm Daniel -- Poet, Writer, and Tech Tinkerer

Welcome to my online home. Here's where you can find the latest information about me, my current [web development adventures](/notes/website), my poetry<Marginnote count={1}>I chose to publish my poetry under the name D.S. Chapman, but I answer to Daniel!</Marginnote>, and what I'm working on and thinking about.

This space is designed to be a [digital garden](/notes/digital-garden)<Footnote count={1}>For more information on this topic, check out my working notes.</Footnote>. The goal is to combine <Linktip tiptext="Delineated by these blue highlights">[notes](/notes)</Linktip> and more <Tooltip tiptext={<span>like my <a href="/articles">Articles</a> or <a href="/poetry">Poetry</a></span>}>finished pieces</Tooltip> into an organic space that grows as I work and tend it.

My background is in the Liberal Arts (literature), but I've worked in cybersecurity and non-profit communications while tinkering with and learning about new technologies. <Marginnote count={2}>One of my biggest tinkering projects has been [coding this website](/articles/how-i-coded-this-website)</Marginnote>
