# I'm D.S. Chapman -- Poet, Writer, and Tinkerer

Welcome to my online home. Here's where you can find the latest information about me, my poetry, and what I'm working on and thinking about.

This space is designed to be a [digital garden](/notes/digital-garden). The goal is to combine <Tooltip tiptext="Delineated by these blue highlights">[notes](/notes)</Tooltip> and more <Tooltip tiptext={<span>Like my <a href="/articles">Articles</a> or <a href="/poetry">Poetry</a></span>}>finished pieces</Tooltip> into an organic space that grows as I work and tend it.
