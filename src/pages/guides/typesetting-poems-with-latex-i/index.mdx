excerpt: "There are not many options when trying to typset a collection of poetry. A word processor provides the necessary functionality, but it is not well suited for the work. Adobe's InDesign provides the necessary precision but at a high cost, especially for smaller teams attempting to compile poems without paying Adobe's monthly fees. For those who are looking for alternatives, LaTeX provides both the precision and due to its license its available at the lovely price of free!"

There are not many options when trying to typset a collection of poetry. A word processor provides the necessary functionality, but it is not well suited for the work. Adobe's InDesign provides the necessary precision but at a high cost, especially for smaller teams attempting to compile poems without paying Adobe's monthly fees. For those who are looking for alternatives, LaTeX provides both the precision and due to [its license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX_Project_Public_License) its available at the lovely price of free!

## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a typesetting software. Unlike other document preparation software, LaTeX is not a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), but uses a markup-like syntax to outline the specifications of the document. 

What that means in practice is that a LaTeX document reads much like an HTML document, with declarations and tags outlining different elements of the document.

```LaTeX
\\documentclass{book}
\\usepackage{fancyhdr} %different packages provide different functionality
\\begin{document}
The text of the document goes here.
\\end{document}
```

## Why use LaTeX?

## Installing LaTeX

In order to start compiling your poems with LaTeX you will need

**1. To Install LaTeX**

I recommend that you use [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). The TeX User Group website provides installations and instructions for [Windows](https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html), [MacOS](https://www.tug.org/mactex/), and [Linux](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html). There are [other free distributions of LaTeX](http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free); however, TeX Live is the most compatible with my text editor of choice.

**2. A Text Editor**

You can use whatever text editor you're most comfortable with to compose your document; however, I recommend Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Available on all platforms) since it integrates with LaTeX using the [LaTeX Workshop Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) and allows you to compose and preview the output of your LaTeX in the same window.

(For more information on installing and managing extensions on VS Code check out [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery))

Alternatively you can also use [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com) to edit your LaTeX documents. You will need to create an account, but once you do you can immediately start editing your document from your browser without installing anything!
