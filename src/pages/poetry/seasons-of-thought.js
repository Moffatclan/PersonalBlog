                    Can words still kiss,<br/>
                    or has the spark fled?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Do their voices crack, <br/>
                    Bounce like empty shells?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Or after all this time<br/>
                    can they sit still<br/>
                    <br/>
                    in the same room &mdash;<br/>
                    speaking love <br/>
                    in silence?

                <Poem title="Bird Song" bg="#e8fffe" align="left"> 
                    The evening sky resounds with grace<br/>
                    &emsp;the echoing fullness of a closing day,<br/>
                    &emsp;which on inspection was the same<br/>
                    &emsp;amalgamation of dissonant chords<br/>
                    &emsp;and harsh wasting words as always.<br/>
                    Yet the song birds still chant up their praise<br/>
                    &emsp;which rises till it resonates<br/>
                    &emsp;sending the shivers of their song in colors<br/>
                    &emsp;humming at the frequency of joy,<br/>
                    despite anything I try to say to the contrary.

                <Poem title="Berry Picking" bg="#eff8ff" align="left"> 
                    How do you choose your favorite color?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    "If you swing a bucket fast enough<br/>
                    no berries will drop out."<br/>
                    &emsp;<i>Look for the flash of blue</i><br/>
                    &emsp;<i>falling to the earth from the silver ship</i><br/>
                    <br/>
                    I did, but I saw only the blue sky,<br/>
                    the twinkle in two blue eyes<br/>
                    and only after I stretched and jumped<br/>
                    peering into the ship<br/>
                    did I see the crew of berries -<br/>
                    blue and calm as a mountain lake,<br/>
                    fresh and sweeter than water.

                <Poem title="Sunset" bg="#fff5eb" align="left"> 
                Drained, dropping, the screen is fading,<br/>
                music ending, bar is closing.<br/>
                Final curtain call is coming.<br/>
                Light is waning. Light is waning.<br/>
                <br/>
                Water falling without purpose<br/>
                sometimes frozen, sometimes sodden,<br/>
                freezing one day, hot the other.<br/>
                Drums keep playing. Light is waning.<br/>
                <br/>
                Words continue through the darkness<br/>
                movie kisses, backstage lovers<br/>
                silence in the writerâ€™s workshop<br/>
                save a tapping through the shadow.<br/>
                <br/>
                Light is fading over ocean<br/>
                as one lover leaves the gangplank.<br/>
                Ship is casting off at nightfall.<br/>
                Love is constant. (Is it waning?)<br/>
                <br/>
                Love is constant, through the waning<br/>
                though its form is always changing,<br/>
                shining though the curtain closes<br/>
                even when it never opens.<br/>
                <br/>
                Drain a life to dregs of sadness<br/>
                it will echo to a rhythm.<br/>
                Feet are tapping, lips are thrumming<br/>
                even while the light is waning.
