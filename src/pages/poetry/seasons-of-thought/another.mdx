Without another eye  
to move my gaze from where it rests  
I would not see the little things;  
my words could not astonish me.

Without another ear
to hear the words I thought I said  
I would not care to check my thoughts;  
I would not think to fear the truth.

Without another voice  
to question what I really meant  
and push against my words with words,  
the tongue would hush within my mind.

But eye, and ear, and voice, and mind  
combine to find a fitting form  
to bring before their foreign friendâ€“  
a poem to surprise us both.
