Seasons of Thought is a collection of poetry that traces its themes across the changing seasons. The poems in the collection use the passage of time as a canvas to explore nature, family, childhood, faith, and other aspects of the human condition. Seasons of Thought is my first collection of poetry which came out of a year-long project [where I wrote a poem every day](/articles/on-writing-poems-daily).
